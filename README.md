This Credit Card Fraud Detection project uses a Random Forest Classifier to analyze 200,000+ transactions and classify them as fraudulent or legitimate. The model achieves 99.96% accuracy, with a precision of 96.25%, recall of 78.57%, F1-score of 86.52%, and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.869. Built using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, it includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation with detailed visualizations. Future enhancements could involve testing advanced models like XGBoost or integrating real-time fraud detection APIs.
